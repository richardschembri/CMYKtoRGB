# CMYKtoRGB
Just an app I threw together over a weekend for non tech savvy users. Basically converts CMYK images to RGB with the option of making a smaller/thumbnail versions. Makes use of parallelism in order to get through the files quicker. Since this was a quickly thrown together so there might be bugs.
